## Final Grade: 18/20

### Project - FireBoy & WaterGirl (Grade: 19,81/20)

Adaptation of the **FireBoy & WaterGirl** game developed using the Minix operating system, which incorporates the implementation of device drivers and interrupt handlers for all the devices taught in the Curricular Unit, including the timer, keyboard, mouse, and video graphics. Additionally, we implemented the two extra suggested devices, the real-time counter and serial port. The serial port module enables the multiplayer mode, allowing two terminals/computers to exchange information and play simultaneously with each other.
